# Project foundation
In ML module of this course, I've gained a good understanding of core machine learning concepts and techniques, which are crucial for this project. The key areas of learning include:

* Supervised Learning: Build and evaluate models like Linear Regression and Decision Trees to predict a specific outcome.

* Unsupervised Learning: Explore K-Means Clustering to discover hidden patterns and group similar data points without predefined labels.

* Model Building Fundamentals: I've also put together a simple, beginner-friendly guide that outlines the key steps to build your first machine learning model.

# Problem statement

AllLife Bank aims to expand its base of personal loan customers by converting liability customers (depositors) into borrowers. A previous campaign achieved a conversion rate of over 9%, indicating potential growth opportunities in this area. The current task is to develop a predictive model to identify **customer attributes** that significantly influence loan purchases and to determine **segments of customers** with a higher probability of opting for personal loans. This model will assist in targeted marketing efforts, enhancing the effectiveness of future campaigns.

## Environment Setup
1. Python virtual environment:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install Required Packages

After activating the virtual environment, install the necessary packages listed in `requirements.txt`:
